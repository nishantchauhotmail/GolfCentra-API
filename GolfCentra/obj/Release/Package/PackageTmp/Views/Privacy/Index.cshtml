            <h1 style="font-size:14px;">OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">
                We respect and are committed towards protecting your privacy. As part of the normal operation of the Mobile Application, we collect and, in some cases, may disclose Personal Information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the Personal Information we collect about you and what may happen to that Personal Information.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">By accepting this Privacy Policy and our Terms, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your Personal Information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms and subject to the terms of the Terms, governs all use of the Mobile Application.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">In the course of registering for and availing various Services we provide from time to time through our Mobile Application, we may collect your title, name, gender, email address, postal address, delivery address (if different), telephone number, mobile number, fax number, payment details, payment card details or bank account details, service usage, log information, IP Address, data collected through cookies and other personally identifiable information (collectively "Personal Information") through the Mobile Application. We may seek additional information for new services that may be offered by us from time to time. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Mobile Application, we may collect such information into a file specific to you, and it shall also form a part of your Personal Information. Your Personal Information will not be posted in areas of the Mobile Application viewable by the public or other users of the Mobile Application.</p>

        </div>

        <div style="float:left; width:100%;">
            <h1 style="font-size:14px;">OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience. The Personal Information is used for two general purposes: to process your order, and to provide you with the best possible services. This allows us to provide services and features that are most likely to meet your needs, and to customize the Mobile Application and our Services to make your experience easier.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="float:left; width:100%;">
            <h1 style="font-size:14px;">OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your Personal Information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be required to disclose your Personal Information to the government, law enforcement agencies, or third parties under certain circumstances; third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications; or users or authorized users may independently abuse or misuse your information that they collect from the Mobile Application in violation of our Mobile Application's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Therefore, although we use industry standard information security practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain private.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any Personally Information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your Personally Information may be disclosed.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;"><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We may aggregate (gather data across all Users) Personal Information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;"> <strong> Other Corporate Entities:</strong> We may sometimes share data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures and third party service providers that provide us with services and/or provide you with services. We use third-party service providers to process purchases you make and to monitor our Users' interests. To the extent that these entities have access to your Personal Information, we will ask them to treat it at least as protectively as they treat personally identifiable information they obtain from their other users or members. Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures will follow privacy practices no less protective of all users and members than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. It is possible that golfcentra, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that golfcentra would share some or all of your Personal Information in order to continue to maintain and provide access to the Mobile Application.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;"><strong> Legal Requests:</strong> golfcentra co-operates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws relating to matters, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any Personal Information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe reasonably necessary or appropriate, in connection with any investigation.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="float:left; width:100%;">
            <h1 style="font-size:14px;">DATA RETENTION POLICY</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">We will retain data for as long as you use the Mobile Application and it would continue for a reasonable time thereafter. Please note that some or all of the provided data may be required in order for the Mobile Application to function properly. If you wish to stop us from collecting any personal Information or other data, you may uninstall the Mobile Application. </p>
        </div>

        <div style="float:left; width:100%;">
            <h1 style="font-size:14px;">TRANSFER OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h1>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">The Personal Information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at locations that are outside the territory of India. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the territory of India, who work for or are engaged by golfcentra.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:14px;">Since the transmission of any information across the internet is not completely secure, we have implemented strong security measures and will do our best to protect your Personal Information.

You have the right to refuse any marketing email from us in the future. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. We will, however, retain in our files and databases Personal Information you have requested to remove in order to use it in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use. Further, such prior Personal Information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personal Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>
