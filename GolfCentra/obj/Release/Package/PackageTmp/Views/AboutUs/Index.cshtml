        DESIGNED TO BE ICONIC
    </h4>
    <p style="float:left;width: 100%; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">In the early nineties, the golf market in Delhi was ready for a truly international course.</p>
    <p style="float:left;width: 100%; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">The idea of a unique destination was conceived, that would be the first of its kind in the country – the ideal golfing destination for any golfer, a resort that would match any course across the world.</p>

    <p style="float:left;width: 100%; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">
        With this concept in place, the legendary designer and golfer of the century was engaged to design the first International standard golf course in India. The result was the Classic Golf & Country Club, the first of its kind 27-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus in South East Asia. Nicklaus, nicknamed “The Golden Bear” is widely regarded as the greatest professional golfer of all time, winning a total of 18 career Major Championships over a span of 25 years.

It also offers a Social Club and Sports Complex, which provides non-golfing sports and recreational activities. The Classic Golf & Country Club is open to members’ guests as well.

        Created by Landbase India Ltd., the golf course has been transformed with prodigious care and skill over the years from a barren, sandy plain to one of India’s finest courses. Furthermore, for the first time in the history of golf course construction, 100% organic material was used to induce nutrients to the arid, sandy soil. Today the lush greenery you see all around is due to organic matter like neem cake, leaf mould and farmyard manure.
